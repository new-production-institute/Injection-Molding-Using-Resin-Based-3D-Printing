# Beginner-Friendly Guide: Using the INJEKTOâ€‘3 by ActionBOX

This guide explains, in simple steps, how to use the **INJEKTOâ€‘3 desktop injection molding machine** for DIY projects and prototypes. No prior industrial experience required.

## 1. Preparing Materials & Mold

### Plastic Pellets
The machine works with common thermoplastics* (plastics that melt when heated and solidify when cooled):
- **ABS** (strong, common in consumer goods): 220â€“250â€¯Â°C.
- **PP â€“ Polypropylene** (lightweight, flexible): 200â€“220â€¯Â°C.
- **PETG** (durable, transparent): 220â€“240â€¯Â°C. *Must be dried beforehand to remove moisture.*
- **PLA** (biodegradable, easy to use): 180â€“210â€¯Â°C.

ðŸ‘‰ Tip: If your pellets absorb water (like PETG or Nylon), dry them in an oven at 60â€“70â€¯Â°C for a few hours. Wet pellets can cause bubbles in the part.


### Mold
**Holding the mold closed:**  
The mold must stay tightly shut while injecting. You can:
- Use **screw clamps (Schraubzwingen)** to hold the halves together.
- Or bolt them together with **screws**.

### Positioning & Pressure
The nozzle of the INJEKTOâ€‘3 must press tightly against the mold to prevent leaks.  
Since the machine itself does not clamp the mold automatically, you can:
- Place the mold on a **lab scissor lift** and raise it against the nozzle.
- Or use a **small car jack** under the mold to push it upward.

The goal is a firm seal between nozzle and sprue entry.

## 2. Machine Setup

1. **Preheat** the barrel to the correct temperature for your chosen plastic.  
2. **Wait 10â€“20 minutes** even after the display shows the target temperature â€“ this ensures the barrel is evenly heated.
3. **Fill the injection cylinder carefully**: Pour pellets slowly into the hopper so they flow down into the heated cylinder. Use a tool (like a wooden stick) to gently push pellets down if needed.  
   - Keep checking during operation and **add pellets regularly** to keep the cylinder full. This ensures steady injection without air gaps.
4. **Purge** a small amount of molten plastic to clear the nozzle before injecting into the mold.

## 3. Injection Cycle

1. With the mold pressed firmly against the nozzle, start the injection cycle by pressing the button.  
2. The melted plastic is pushed (injected) into the mold cavity.  
3. Keep a little **holding pressure** for a few seconds so the cavity fills completely.
4. Let the mold cool down before removing it.  
5. Open the mold and remove your part.

## 4. Iteration & Troubleshooting

It is normal that the first shot is not perfect. Adjust step by step:
- **Short shots*** (cavity not full) â†’ raise temperature slightly or add more pressure/time.
- **Flash*** (excess plastic leaking out of mold edges) â†’ lower pressure or clamp more tightly.
- **Bubbles/voids*** â†’ dry pellets better, check mold vents.
- **Sticking*** â†’ add draft angle, polish the cavity, or use mold release spray.

ðŸ‘‰ Always change one variable at a time so you know what fixed the problem.

## 5. Safety Basics

- Wear **safety glasses** and **heatâ€‘resistant gloves**.
- Work in a ventilated area â€“ melting plastics can release fumes.
- Do not exceed the rated temperature or pressure of the machine.
- Keep a **fire extinguisher** nearby just in case.
- Regularly check hoses and connections for leaks or damage.

## 6. Key Terms Explained

- **Thermoplastic***: Plastic that softens when heated and hardens again when cooled.
- **Sprue***: Main channel where the molten plastic enters the mold.
- **Gate***: Small passage that leads from the sprue into the part cavity.
- **Flash***: Thin layer of extra plastic that seeps out along the mold split line.
- **Short shot***: When the cavity isnâ€™t fully filled with plastic.
