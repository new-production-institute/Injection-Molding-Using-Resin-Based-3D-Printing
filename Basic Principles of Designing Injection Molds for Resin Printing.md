# Basic Principles of Designing Injection Molds for Resin Printing

This guide explains how to **design injection molds** optimized for MSLA resin printing. It covers key principles, step-by-step workflow, practical tips, and best practices to help you create durable, functional molds.

## 1. Design Principles

When designing injection molds, consider the following factors:

* **Mold Orientation**

  * Avoid placing the cavity against the build plate.
  * Orient molds to minimize supports on critical surfaces.

* **Wall Thickness**

  * Small molds: 3–5 mm walls.
  * Large molds: 5–10 mm walls.
  * Thick walls improve durability under injection pressure.

* **Draft Angles**

  * Include 1–3° draft angles for easy part release.
  * Round internal corners to reduce stress concentration.

* **Solid vs. Hollow Mold**

  * Solid molds: Stronger and less likely to crack.
  * Hollow molds: Save resin but must maintain structural integrity.

* **Thermal & Shrinkage Considerations**

  * Account for resin shrinkage (0.1–0.2 mm per 25 mm).
  * Choose geometry that resists thermal warping.

* **Injection Channels & Venting**

  * Include gates, sprues, and air vents for smooth material flow.

## 2. Workflow for Mold Design

1. **Sketch the Part**

   * Define the part geometry and identify undercuts.

2. **Create Mold Halves**

   * Split the mold logically.
   * Add interlocking features for alignment.

3. **Add Drafts and Fillets**

   * Apply draft angles to cavities.
   * Fillet corners to reduce stress and improve resin flow.

4. **Prepare for Printing**

   * Design flat surfaces for build plate adhesion.
   * Avoid critical areas where supports may touch.

5. **Check Design Constraints**

   * Verify wall thickness, cavity depth, and overhangs for printability.

6. **Prototype**

   * Print a small-scale mold to test fit, surface finish, and durability.
   * Iterate design based on test results.

## 3. Tips & Tricks

* **Avoid undercuts** to simplify mold splitting.
* **Keep cavities simple** to minimize print failures.
* **Design for post-processing**: leave access to polish or sand cavities.
* **Use fillets and chamfers** to improve part ejection and reduce stress.
* **Test early, iterate often**: small prototypes save time and resin.

## 4. Summary

Following these principles ensures your resin-printed molds are **functional, durable, and printable**.
