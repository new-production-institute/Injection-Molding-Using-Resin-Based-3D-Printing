# Low-Cost Injection Molding at the Open Lab

This repository documents an ongoing project exploring low-cost injection molding at the Open Lab. The key idea: using SLA and FDM 3D printing to create custom molds â€” an affordable and accessible approach for makers, educators, and FabLabs.

## Current Status

We are still in the process of setting up and learning how to use the injection molding machine available at the Open Lab. In parallel, we are still testing our SLA-printer to produce quality molds.

A full documentation including tutorials, example projects, and mold design guidelines will be added here soon.

Stay tuned!
