# Hands on guide: Creating an example mold with CAD
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a simple injection mold to give you an idea of the workflow and how you get started.

In this guide, we will use the non-commercial software Fusion 360. Feel free to use your favorite CAD programm.

## 1. Find a test object
For this guide we will work with this drone propeller. You can find its stl and step model [here](Mold%20Examples/Prop%20Mold).

If you allready got your model in your CAD software, perfect! Otherwiese, import it into your software. If your model is in an stl format, you need to convert it, so you can work with it in your cad software.

## Creating the mold
Here you can see, how we created our mold arround the prop.
